### 2019

**Auf die Bäume ihr Affen** by Hans A. Pestalozzi  
ISBN: 978-3729603134 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐  
This book is the best retrospective view of the last few years in a political and social point of view. The author is so clear and straight forward in pointing to the causes of our all prblem situations in the current time of life.

**Jäger, Hirten, Kritiker** by Richard David Precht  
ISBN: 978-3442315017 ⭐⭐⭐  
A very good insight into the future problems and obstacles of today's society and possible solutions to counter them. Somewhat too superficial and predictable.

### 2018

**Just for fun (Linus Torvalds)** by David Diamond  
ISBN: 978-3423362993 ⭐⭐⭐⭐  
A really good book in an interview perspective. Linus Torvals tells how he was creating Linux with some nerdy details and how her workflow was/is in maintaining the best operating system in this world.

**Eine Einführung - Einflüsse, Machtstrukturen und Selbstheilung im 21. Jahrhundert** by Vinoth Müller  
ISBN: 978-3741877537 ⭐⭐  
This book written by a "hobby" author who is burning for this topic and all that goes with it. It was really hard read it, cause it seems to be very unstructured and the inexperience of the author makes it difficult to read it as well.

**The great Gatsby** by F. Scott Fitzgerald

Really good written old love story.

### 2017

A futuristic utopia of a society in the future simulated on an island.
