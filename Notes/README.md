# Knowledge

This is a place for some personal notes. I try to use the zettelkasten method.
Thats should help me to summarize all the input that I'm reading day by day. My
workflow is dead simple with a vim plugin (vimwiki/vim-zettel) and a
synchronised folder to my private nextcloud and a github repository for
converting all the notes to a mdbook.
