# Notes

This is a place for some personal notes. I try to use the zettelkasten method. Thats should help me to summarize all the input that I'm reading day by day. My workflow is dead simple with a vim plugin (vimwiki/vim-zettel) and a synchronised folder to my private nextcloud and a github repository for converting all the notes to a [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook). On my mobile (iPhone) actually I prefer to use [obsidian (mobile)](obsidian.md) for editing my markdown files and sync these via WebDAV on my Nextcloud.
