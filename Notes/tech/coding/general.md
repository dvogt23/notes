### Postmortem
A tool for summarize a critical situation in collaboration with all involved people.

Main lessons:

1. Maintain critical equipment proactively
2. Avoid panic and act deliberately under pressure
3. Use mistakes to improve systems and personal skills
4. Failures often compound, so minimize risks early
5. Decision-making under stress can and should be practiced

Great example of using personal experience to showcase technical and soft skills.
