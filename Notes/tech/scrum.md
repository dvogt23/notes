# Scrum

Thats the most prefered agile software development method that I mostly worked with in DIFFERENT ways and most of the time, in a bad way (non-productive).

## Daily

 - good way:
   
    Everbody talk about their blockers or challenges for the task of that day.
    Pushes some urgent pull-requests for code-review or ask for clearafications
    from front-/back-end. Talk about upcoming releases and their open todos.

 - bad way:
    
    Everyone just saying what they did yesterday and whats the plan for that
    day.

## Review

 - good way:
   
    Present something important things or howto for usage of a finished feature to the product owner.

 - bad way:
    
    Everyone summarize the tasks of the finished sprint from own perspective.

## Retrospective

 - good way:
   
   Great tool for retrospectives is [team-o-clock](https://www.teamoclock.com)

    - Step 1 (retro):
    
        Everone inputs some points into the i.e. following columns.

| House of straw | House of sticks | House of bricks |
| ---            | ---             | ---             |
| ...            | ...             | ...             |
  
| Start          | Stop            | Continue        |
| ---            | ---             | ---             |
| ...            | ...             | ...             |
  
| Liked | Learned | Lacked | Longed for |
| ---   | ---     | ---    | ---        |
| ...   | ...     | ...    | ...        |

    - Step 2 (grooming):

      Everyone groom this points together (group them if same topic)

    - Step 3 (voting):

      Everyone awards 3-5 points in total to their most important topics (points)

    - Step 4 (discussion):

      In order to the most important points, everyone explain their point in more detail and discuss together what needs todo.

    - Step 5 (actions):

      Collect some actions (todos) and plan them into the next sprint.

 - bad way:
    
    Just ask for some complications, mostly without some feedback.
