living in the wild like a sheep
alongside are the cliffs so deep
Sitting in the bus listening to Bud's stories
Makes you feel like there are no worries
And all you want is this to keep.

All those greyish stones around
Standing together on the ground
Walls builded by the people
In the back a steeple
And the wind makes a sad sound.

To the cliffs from east to the west
the guide bud does all the best
tells us lots of funny stories
creates for us some new memories
One thing learned again: never rest
